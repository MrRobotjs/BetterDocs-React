# Discord+
**Discord+** is a theme that is both sleek and customizable, without getting in your way. Its top priority is having a balance between looks and performance.

## User customization
This theme aims to be **fully customizable**.
There are variables at the top of the file that allow you to change things like the background image, the roundness of the UI, and the accent color. You can also change the fonts to any fonts installed on your device.

## Complete theme
This theme aims to style everything on Discord. If thereâ€™s anything that is not themed, be it an official feature, a plugin, bug or third party feature, open an issue along with some information about the unthemed feature and I'll see what I can do.

## Cross-platform compatibility
The theme works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. There are some minor differences, though.
Windows has a draggable titlebar (with the Discord+ "logo" for good measure), macOS has window buttons at the top left (sans Discord+ logo), and Linux has your desktop environment's borders (which means I can't customize it).
